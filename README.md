WikiCorpora
===========

WikiCorpora is a tool for building corpora from Wikipedia.
WikiCorpora can download Wikipedia dump for given language,
create samples of desired size,
build vertical files with tagged terms,
perform terms inference on each article,
compile corpora
and test it by [CQL queries](https://www.sketchengine.co.uk/documentation/wiki/SkE/CorpusQuerying).

If you are interested in finall results, have a look at

Installation and configuration
------------------------------

It's supposed to be run on Alba server in Natural Language Processing Centre
at the Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, Brno. Some portions of
the code can be run anywhere, but for full functionality WikiCorpora depends
on several NLP tools, such as unitok, desamb, treetagger and compilecorp.

To install WikiCorpora, just clone this repository anywhere and
create local environment configuration file with name `environment-config.yaml`
in project root directory. Content of the configuration file is following:

```
paths:
    verticals:          '<path to directory for all verticals>'
    registry:           '<path to directory for registry files'
    compiled-corpora:   '<path to directory for compiled corpora>'
    logfile:            '<path to log file>'
tools:
    unitok:             '<path to unitok>'
    sentence-tagger:    '<path to sentence-tagger script>'
    desamb:             '<path to desamb>'
    treetagger:         '<path to treetagger scripts (using substituable {lang})>'
    treetagger-en:      '<path to special treetagger script for english>'
```

As a fallback, `environment-config-default.yaml` is used.
